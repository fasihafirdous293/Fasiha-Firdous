  <br>  Main course meals are had during lunch and dinners. Though we can have a light dinner, but one should always have a proper breakfast and a good lunch. I am sharing a collection of some vegetarian recipes that can be made for either lunch or dinner.<br>
    
           <br>The idea is not just to share the recipe, but you will also get ideas based on the collection and can try or make some other recipe not posted here.<br>
   <br>
    I have included both North Indian and South Indian dinner recipes. In North India usually different types of sabzi or gravy recipes are made for dinner and served with roti or phulka. However rajma chawal and kadhi chawal are two popular rice recipes that are made for dinner.
<br>
<br>
           For some recipes like <strong>rajma masala</strong> or <strong>chana masala</strong>, you do need to do some prep work beforehand like soaking the <strong>kidney beans or chickpeas.</strong>
<br>
<br>
For making dishes like kadhi or curd rice, you need to set the curd overnight before preparing.
<br>
<br>
If you plan to make <strong>South Indian Recipes like </strong>Idli, Dosa or Uttapam then you need to prepare the batter previous night. So do plan accordingly.

<br>
    In south India apart from chapathi, various rice dishes are also made for lunch and dinner. There are a variety of rice recipes popular in South India like:
<br>
 <strong> <br>Lemon rice
         <br>Ghee rice<br>
Coconut rice<br>
Curd rice<br>
Tomato rice<br>
Peanut rice<br></strong>
<br>These rice recipes can be had alone as a dinner or lunch or they can also be served in small quantities along with other dishes.<br>
  <br>
    <b>Example:</b> when I make steamed rice with Rasam then I also make some dry sabzi like<strong> Carrot poriyal or Vendakkai poriyal or Kovakkai Poriyal or a simple potato fry or bhindi sabzi</strong> to go along with it. 
<br>
  <br>
Make sure your meal is healthy, wholesome and is prepared fresh and had hot. Do try to include a veggie salad, raita, one to two vegetable side dishes or chutney whenever possible.
